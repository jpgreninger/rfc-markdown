## 4 General

### 4.1 Introduction

The objective is to describe the RLC architecture and the RLC entities from a functional point of view.

### 4.2 RLC architecture

### 4.2.1 RLC entities

The description in this sub clause is a model and does not specify or restrict implementations.

RRC is generally in control of the RLC configuration. For NB-IoT, RRC configurable parameters are specified in RLC-Config-NB [5].

Functions of the RLC sub layer are performed by RLC entities. For a RLC entity configured at the eNB, there is a peer RLC entity configured at the UE and vice versa. For an RLC entity configured at the transmitting UE for STCH or SBCCH there is a peer RLC entity configured at each receiving UE for STCH or SBCCH.

An RLC entity receives/delivers RLC SDUs from/to upper layer and sends/receives RLC PDUs to/from its peer RLC entity via lower layers. An RLC PDU can either be a RLC data PDU (see sub clause 6.1.1) or a RLC control PDU (see sub clause 6.1.2). If an RLC entity receives RLC SDUs from upper layer, it receives them through a single SAP between RLC and upper layer, and after forming RLC data PDUs from the received RLC SDUs, the RLC entity delivers the RLC data PDUs to lower layer through a single logical channel. If an RLC entity receives RLC data PDUs from lower layer, it receives them through a single logical channel, and after forming RLC SDUs from the received RLC data PDUs, the RLC entity delivers the RLC SDUs to upper layer through a single SAP between RLC and upper layer. If an RLC entity delivers/receives RLC control PDUs to/from lower layer, it delivers/receives them through the same logical channel it delivers/receives the RLC data PDUs through.

An RLC entity can be configured to perform data transfer in one of the following three modes: Transparent Mode (TM), Unacknowledged Mode (UM) or Acknowledged Mode (AM). Consequently, an RLC entity is categorized as a TM RLC entity, an UM RLC entity or an AM RLC entity depending on the mode of data transfer that the RLC entity is configured to provide. For NB-IoT, RLC UM is not supported.

A TM RLC entity is configured either as a transmitting TM RLC entity or a receiving TM RLC entity. The transmitting TM RLC entity receives RLC SDUs from upper layer and sends RLC PDUs to its peer receiving TM RLC entity via lower layers. The receiving TM RLC entity delivers RLC SDUs to upper layer and receives RLC PDUs from its peer transmitting TM RLC entity via lower layers.

An UM RLC entity is configured either as a transmitting UM RLC entity or a receiving UM RLC entity. The transmitting UM RLC entity receives RLC SDUs from upper layer and sends RLC PDUs to its peer receiving UM RLC entity via lower layers. The receiving UM RLC entity delivers RLC SDUs to upper layer and receives RLC PDUs from its peer transmitting UM RLC entity via lower layers.

An AM RLC entity consists of a transmitting side and a receiving side. The transmitting side of an AM RLC entity receives RLC SDUs from upper layer and sends RLC PDUs to its peer AM RLC entity via lower layers. The receiving side of an AM RLC entity delivers RLC SDUs to upper layer and receives RLC PDUs from its peer AM RLC entity via lower layers.

Figure 4.2.1-1 illustrates the overview model of the RLC sub layer.

Figure 4.2.1-1: Overview model of the RLC sub layer

The following applies to all RLC entity types (i.e. TM, UM and AM RLC entity):

- RLC SDUs of variable sizes which are byte aligned (i.e. multiple of 8 bits) are supported;
- RLC PDUs are formed only when a transmission opportunity has been notified by lower layer (i.e. by MAC) and are then delivered to lower layer.

Description of different RLC entity types are provided below.

### 4.2.1.2.3 Receiving UM RLC entity

When a receiving UM RLC entity receives UMD PDUs, it shall:

- detect whether or not the UMD PDUs have been received in duplication, and discard duplicated UMD PDUs;
- reorder the UMD PDUs if they are received out of sequence;
- detect the loss of UMD PDUs at lower layers and avoid excessive reordering delays;
- reassemble RLC SDUs from the reordered UMD PDUs (not accounting for RLC PDUs for which losses have been detected) and deliver the RLC SDUs to upper layer in ascending order of the RLC SN;
- discard received UMD PDUs that cannot be re-assembled into a RLC SDU due to loss at lower layers of an UMD PDU which belonged to the particular RLC SDU.

At the time of RLC re-establishment, the receiving UM RLC entity shall:

- if possible, reassemble RLC SDUs from the UMD PDUs that are received out of sequence and deliver them to upper layer;
- discard any remaining UMD PDUs that could not be reassembled into RLC SDUs;
- initialize relevant state variables and stop relevant timers.

### 4.2.1.3.2 Transmitting side

When the transmitting side of an AM RLC entity forms AMD PDUs from RLC SDUs, it shall:

- segment and/or concatenate the RLC SDUs so that the AMD PDUs fit within the total size of RLC PDU(s) indicated by lower layer at the particular transmission opportunity notified by lower layer.

The transmitting side of an AM RLC entity supports retransmission of RLC data PDUs (ARQ):

- if the RLC data PDU to be retransmitted does not fit within the total size of RLC PDU(s) indicated by lower layer at the particular transmission opportunity notified by lower layer, the AM RLC entity can re-segment the RLC data PDU into AMD PDU segments;
- the number of re-segmentation is not limited.

When the transmitting side of an AM RLC entity forms AMD PDUs from RLC SDUs received from upper layer or AMD PDU segments from RLC data PDUs to be retransmitted, it shall:

- include relevant RLC headers in the RLC data PDU.


### 4.2.1.3.3 Receiving side

When the receiving side of an AM RLC entity receives RLC data PDUs, it shall:

- detect whether or not the RLC data PDUs have been received in duplication, and discard duplicated RLC data PDUs;
- reorder the RLC data PDUs if they are received out of sequence;
- detect the loss of RLC data PDUs at lower layers and request retransmissions to its peer AM RLC entity;
- reassemble RLC SDUs from the reordered RLC data PDUs and deliver the RLC SDUs to upper layer in sequence.

At the time of RLC re-establishment, the receiving side of an AM RLC entity shall:

- if possible, reassemble RLC SDUs from the RLC data PDUs that are received out of sequence and deliver them to upper layer;
- discard any remaining RLC data PDUs that could not be reassembled into RLC SDUs;

- notification of a transmission opportunity, together with the total size of the RLC PDU(s) to be transmitted in the transmission opportunity.


### 4.4 Functions

The following functions are supported by the RLC sub layer:

- transfer of upper layer PDUs;
- error correction through ARQ (only for AM data transfer);

### 4.5 Data available for transmission

For the purpose of MAC buffer status reporting, the UE shall consider the following as data available for transmission in the RLC layer:

- RLC SDUs, or segments thereof, that have not yet been included in an RLC data PDU;
- RLC data PDUs, or portions thereof, that are pending for retransmission (RLC AM).

In addition, if a STATUS PDU has been triggered and $t$-StatusProhibit is not running or has expired, the UE shall estimate the size of the STATUS PDU that will be transmitted in the next transmission opportunity, and consider this as data available for transmission in the RLC layer.

The transmitting side of an AM RLC entity shall prioritize transmission of RLC control PDUs over RLC data PDUs. The transmitting side of an AM RLC entity shall prioritize retransmission of RLC data PDUs over transmission of new AMD PDUs.

The transmitting side of an AM RLC entity shall maintain a transmitting window according to state variables VT(A) and VT(MS) as follows:

- a SN falls within the transmitting window if VT(A) <= SN < VT(MS);
- a SN falls outside of the transmitting window otherwise.

The transmitting side of an AM RLC entity shall not deliver to lower layer any RLC data PDU whose SN falls outside of the transmitting window.

When delivering a new AMD PDU to lower layer, the transmitting side of an AM RLC entity shall:

- set the SN of the AMD PDU to VT(S), and then increment VT(S) by one.

The transmitting side of an AM RLC entity can receive a positive acknowledgement (confirmation of successful reception by its peer AM RLC entity) for a RLC data PDU by the following:

- STATUS PDU from its peer AM RLC entity.

When receiving a positive acknowledgement for an AMD PDU with SN $=\mathrm{VT}(\mathrm{A})$, the transmitting side of an AM RLC entity shall:

- set $\mathrm{VT}(\mathrm{A})$ equal to the SN of the AMD PDU with the smallest SN, whose SN falls within the range VT(A)<= SN <= VT(S) and for which a positive acknowledgment has not been received yet.
- if positive acknowledgements have been received for all AMD PDUs associated with a transmitted RLC SDU:
- send an indication to the upper layers of successful delivery of the RLC SDU.


### 5.1.3.2 Receive operations

### 5.1.3.2.1 General

The receiving side of an AM RLC entity shall maintain a receiving window according to state variables VR(R) and VR(MR) as follows:

- a SN falls within the receiving window if $\mathrm{VR}(\mathrm{R})<=\mathrm{SN}<\mathrm{VR}(\mathrm{MR})$;
- a SN falls outside of the receiving window otherwise.

When receiving a RLC data PDU from lower layer, the receiving side of an AM RLC entity shall:

- either discard the received RLC data PDU or place it in the reception buffer (see sub clause 5.1.3.2.2);
- if the received RLC data PDU was placed in the reception buffer:
- update state variables, reassemble and deliver RLC SDUs to upper layer and start/stop $t$-Reordering as needed (see sub clause 5.1.3.2.3).

When $t$-Reordering expires, the receiving side of an AM RLC entity shall:

- update state variables and start $t$-Reordering as needed (see sub clause 5.1.3.2.4).

For NB-IoT;

- The receiving side of an RLC entity shall behave such that the timer values of $t$-Reordering and $t$-StatusProhibit are 0 .


### 5.1.3.2.2 Actions when a RLC data PDU is received from lower layer

When a RLC data PDU is received from lower layer, where the RLC data PDU contains byte segment numbers y to z of an AMD PDU with $\mathrm{SN}=\mathrm{x}$, the receiving side of an AM RLC entity shall:

- if x falls outside of the receiving window; or
- if byte segment numbers y to z of the AMD PDU with $\mathrm{SN}=\mathrm{x}$ have been received before:
- discard the received RLC data PDU;
- else:
- place the received RLC data PDU in the reception buffer;
- if some byte segments of the AMD PDU contained in the RLC data PDU have been received before:
- discard the duplicate byte segments.


### 5.1.3.2.3 Actions when a RLC data PDU is placed in the reception buffer

When a RLC data PDU with SN $=\mathrm{x}$ is placed in the reception buffer, the receiving side of an AM RLC entity shall:

- if $\mathrm{x}>=\mathrm{VR}(\mathrm{H})$
- update $\operatorname{VR}(\mathrm{H})$ to $\mathrm{x}+1$;
- if all byte segments of the AMD PDU with SN $=\mathrm{VR}(\mathrm{MS})$ are received:
- update VR(MS) to the SN of the first AMD PDU with SN > current VR(MS) for which not all byte segments have been received;
- if $\mathrm{x}=\mathrm{VR}(\mathrm{R})$ :
- if all byte segments of the AMD PDU with $\mathrm{SN}=\mathrm{VR}(\mathrm{R})$ are received:
- update $\mathrm{VR}(\mathrm{R})$ to the SN of the first AMD PDU with SN > current VR(R) for which not all byte segments have been received;
- update VR(MR) to the updated VR(R) + AM_Window_Size;
- reassemble RLC SDUs from any byte segments of AMD PDUs with SN that falls outside of the receiving window and in-sequence byte segments of the AMD PDU with SN $=\mathrm{VR}(\mathrm{R})$, remove RLC headers when doing so and deliver the reassembled RLC SDUs to upper layer in sequence if not delivered before;
- if $t$-Reordering is running:
- if $\operatorname{VR}(\mathrm{X})=\operatorname{VR}(\mathrm{R})$; or
- if $\operatorname{VR}(\mathrm{X})$ falls outside of the receiving window and $\operatorname{VR}(\mathrm{X})$ is not equal to $\operatorname{VR}(\mathrm{MR})$ :
- stop and reset $t$-Reordering;
- if $t$-Reordering is not running (includes the case $t$-Reordering is stopped due to actions above):
- if VR (H) > VR(R):
- start $t$-Reordering;
- set VR(X) to VR(H).


### 5.1.3.2.4 Actions when $t$-Reordering expires

When $t$-Reordering expires, the receiving side of an AM RLC entity shall:

- update VR(MS) to the SN of the first AMD PDU with SN >= VR(X) for which not all byte segments have been received;
- if VR(H) > VR(MS):
- start $t$-Reordering;
- set VR(X) to VR(H).


### 5.2 ARQ procedures

ARQ procedures are only performed by an AM RLC entity.

### 5.2.1 Retransmission

The transmitting side of an AM RLC entity can receive a negative acknowledgement (notification of reception failure by its peer AM RLC entity) for an AMD PDU or a portion of an AMD PDU by the following:

- STATUS PDU from its peer AM RLC entity.

When receiving a negative acknowledgement for an AMD PDU or a portion of an AMD PDU by a STATUS PDU from its peer AM RLC entity, the transmitting side of the AM RLC entity shall:

- if the SN of the corresponding AMD PDU falls within the range VT(A) $<=\mathrm{SN}<\mathrm{VT}(\mathrm{S})$ :
- consider the AMD PDU or the portion of the AMD PDU for which a negative acknowledgement was received for retransmission.

When an AMD PDU or a portion of an AMD PDU is considered for retransmission, the transmitting side of the AM RLC entity shall:

- if the AMD PDU is considered for retransmission for the first time:
- set the RETX_COUNT associated with the AMD PDU to zero;
- else, if it (the AMD PDU or the portion of the AMD PDU that is considered for retransmission) is not pending for retransmission already, or a portion of it is not pending for retransmission already:
- increment the RETX_COUNT;
- if RETX_COUNT = maxRetxThreshold:
- indicate to upper layers that max retransmission has been reached.

When retransmitting an AMD PDU, the transmitting side of an AM RLC entity shall:

- if the AMD PDU can entirely fit within the total size of RLC PDU(s) indicated by lower layer at the particular transmission opportunity:
- deliver the AMD PDU as it is except for the P field (the P field should be set according to sub clause 5.2.2) to lower layer;
- otherwise:
- segment the AMD PDU, form a new AMD PDU segment which will fit within the total size of RLC PDU(s) indicated by lower layer at the particular transmission opportunity and deliver the new AMD PDU segment to lower layer.

When retransmitting a portion of an AMD PDU, the transmitting side of an AM RLC entity shall:

- segment the portion of the AMD PDU as necessary, form a new AMD PDU segment which will fit within the total size of RLC PDU(s) indicated by lower layer at the particular transmission opportunity and deliver the new AMD PDU segment to lower layer.

When forming a new AMD PDU segment, the transmitting side of an AM RLC entity shall:

- only map the Data field of the original AMD PDU to the Data field of the new AMD PDU segment;
- set the header of the new AMD PDU segment in accordance with the description in sub clause 6.;
- set the P field according to sub clause 5.2.2.


### 5.2.2 Polling

An AM RLC entity can poll its peer AM RLC entity in order to trigger STATUS reporting at the peer AM RLC entity.

### 5.2.2.1 Transmission of a AMD PDU or AMD PDU segment

Upon assembly of a new AMD PDU, the transmitting side of an AM RLC entity except for NB-IoT shall:

- increment PDU_WITHOUT_POLL by one;
- increment BYTE_WITHOUT_POLL by every new byte of Data field element that it maps to the Data field of the RLC data PDU;
- if PDU_WITHOUT_POLL >= pollPDU; or
- if BYTE_WITHOUT_POLL >= pollByte;
- include a poll in the RLC data PDU as described below.

Upon assembly of an AMD PDU or AMD PDU segment, the transmitting side of an AM RLC entity shall:

- if both the transmission buffer and the retransmission buffer becomes empty (excluding transmitted RLC data PDU awaiting for acknowledgements) after the transmission of the RLC data PDU; or
- if no new RLC data PDU can be transmitted after the transmission of the RLC data PDU (e.g. due to window stalling);
- include a poll in the RLC data PDU as described below.

NOTE: E mpty RLC buffer (excluding transmitted RLC data PDU awaiting for acknowledgements) should not lead to unnecessary polling when data awaits in the upper layer. Details are left up to UE implementation.

To include a poll in a RLC data PDU, the transmitting side of an AM RLC entity shall:

- set the P field of the RLC data PDU to " 1 ";
- set PDU_WITHOUT_POLL to 0 , except for NB-IoT;
- set BYTE_WITHOUT_POLL to 0, except for NB-IoT;

After delivering a RLC data PDU including a poll to lower layer and after incrementing of VT(S) if necessary, the transmitting side of an AM RLC entity shall:

- set POLL_SN to VT(S) - 1;
- if $t$-PollRetransmit is not running:
- start $t$-PollRetransmit;
- else:
- restart $t$-PollRetransmit;


### 5.2.2.2 Reception of a STATUS report

Upon reception of a STATUS report from the receiving RLC AM entity the transmitting side of an AM RLC entity shall:

- if the STATUS report comprises a positive or negative acknowledgement for the RLC data PDU with sequence number equal to POLL_SN:
- if $t$-PollRetransmit is running:
- stop and reset $t$-PollRetransmit.


### 5.2.2.3 Expiry of $t$-PollRetransmit

Upon expiry of $t$-PollRetransmit, the transmitting side of an AM RLC entity shall:

- if both the transmission buffer and the retransmission buffer are empty (excluding transmitted RLC data PDU awaiting for acknowledgements); or
- if no new RLC data PDU can be transmitted (e.g. due to window stalling):
- consider the AMD PDU with $\mathrm{SN}=\mathrm{VT}(\mathrm{S})-1$ for retransmission; or
- consider any AMD PDU which has not been positively acknowledged for retransmission;
- include a poll in a RLC data PDU as described in section 5.2.2.1.


### 5.2.3 Status reporting

An AM RLC entity sends STATUS PDUs to its peer AM RLC entity in order to provide positive and/or negative acknowledgements of RLC PDUs (or portions of them).

Except for NB-IoT, RRC configures whether or not the status prohibit function is to be used for an AM RLC entity. For NB-IoT, RRC configures whether or not the status reporting due to detection of reception failure of an RLC data PDU is to be used for an AM RLC entity.

Triggers to initiate STATUS reporting include:

- Polling from its peer AM RLC entity:
- When a RLC data PDU with $\mathrm{SN}=\mathrm{x}$ and the P field set to " 1 " is received from lower layer, the receiving side of an AM RLC entity shall:
- if the PDU is to be discarded as specified in subclause 5.1.3.2.2; or
- if $\mathrm{x}<\mathrm{VR}(\mathrm{MS})$ or $\mathrm{x}>=\mathrm{VR}(\mathrm{MR})$ :
- trigger a STATUS report;
- else:
- delay triggering the STATUS report until $\mathrm{x}<\mathrm{VR}(\mathrm{MS})$ or $\mathrm{x}>=\mathrm{VR}(\mathrm{MR})$.

NOTE 1: This ensures that the RLC Status report is transmitted after HARQ reordering.

- Detection of reception failure of an RLC data PDU, except for an NB-IoT UE not configured with enableStatusReportSN-Gap:
- The receiving side of an AM RLC entity shall trigger a STATUS report when $t$-Reordering expires.

NOTE 2: The expiry of $t$-Reordering triggers both VR(MS) to be updated and a STATUS report to be triggered, but the STATUS report shall be triggered after VR(MS) is updated.

When STATUS reporting has been triggered, the receiving side of an AM RLC entity shall:

- if $t$-StatusProhibit is not running:
- at the first transmission opportunity indicated by lower layer, construct a STATUS PDU and deliver it to lower layer;
- else:
- at the first transmission opportunity indicated by lower layer after $t$-StatusProhibit expires, construct a single STATUS PDU even if status reporting was triggered several times while $t$-StatusProhibit was running and deliver it to lower layer;

When a STATUS PDU has been delivered to lower layer, the receiving side of an AM RLC entity shall:

- start $t$-StatusProhibit.

When constructing a STATUS PDU, the AM RLC entity shall:

- for the AMD PDUs with SN such that $\operatorname{VR}(\mathrm{R})<=\mathrm{SN}<\operatorname{VR}(\mathrm{MS})$ that has not been completely received yet, in increasing SN order of PDUs and increasing byte segment order within PDUs, starting with SN $=\mathrm{VR}(\mathrm{R})$ up to the point where the resulting STATUS PDU still fits to the total size of RLC PDU(s) indicated by lower layer:
- for an AMD PDU for which no byte segments have been received yet::
- include in the STATUS PDU a NACK_SN which is set to the SN of the AMD PDU;
- for a continuous sequence of byte segments of a partly received AMD PDU that have not been received yet:
- include in the STATUS PDU a set of NACK_SN, SOstart and SOend
- set the ACK_SN to the SN of the next not received RLC Data PDU which is not indicated as missing in the resulting STATUS PDU.


### 5.3 SDU discard procedures

When indicated from upper layer (i.e. PDCP) to discard a particular RLC SDU, the transmitting side of an AM RLC entity or the transmitting UM RLC entity shall discard the indicated RLC SDU if no segment of the RLC SDU has been mapped to a RLC data PDU yet.

### 5.4 Re-establishment procedure

RLC re-establishment is performed upon request by RRC, and the function is applicable for AM, UM and TM RLC entities.

When RRC indicates that an RLC entity should be re-established, the RLC entity shall:

- if it is a transmitting TM RLC entity:
- discard all RLC SDUs;
- if it is a receiving UM RLC entity:
- when possible, reassemble RLC SDUs from UMD PDUs with SN < VR(UH), remove RLC headers when doing so and deliver all reassembled RLC SDUs to upper layer in ascending order of the RLC SN, if not delivered before;
- discard all remaining UMD PDUs;
- if it is a transmitting UM RLC entity:
- discard all RLC SDUs;
- if it is an AM RLC entity:
- when possible, reassemble RLC SDUs from any byte segments of AMD PDUs with SN < VR(MR) in the receiving side, remove RLC headers when doing so and deliver all reassembled RLC SDUs to upper layer in ascending order of the RLC SN, if not delivered before;
- discard the remaining AMD PDUs and byte segments of AMD PDUs in the receiving side;
- discard all RLC SDUs and AMD PDUs in the transmitting side;
- discard all RLC control PDUs.
- stop and reset all timers;
- reset all state variables to their initial values.


### 5.5 Handling of unknown, unforeseen and erroneous protocol data

### 5.5.1 Reception of PDU with reserved or invalid values

When an RLC entity receives an RLC PDU that contains reserved or invalid values, the RLC entity shall:

- discard the received PDU.


## 6 Protocol data units, formats and parameters

### 6.1 Protocol data units

RLC PDUs can be categorized into RLC data PDUs and RLC control PDUs. RLC data PDUs in sub clause 6.1.1 are used by TM, UM and AM RLC entities to transfer upper layer PDUs (i.e. RLC SDUs). RLC control PDUs in sub clause 6.1.2 are used by AM RLC entity to perform ARQ procedures.

### 6.1.1 RLC data PDU

a) TMD PDU

TMD PDU is used to transfer upper layer PDUs by a TM RLC entity.
b) UMD PDU

UMD PDU is used to transfer upper layer PDUs by an UM RLC entity.
c) AMD PDU

AMD PDU is used to transfer upper layer PDUs by an AM RLC entity. It is used when the AM RLC entity transmits (part of) the RLC SDU for the first time, or when the AM RLC entity retransmits an AMD PDU without having to perform re-segmentation.
d) AMD PDU segment

AMD PDU segment is used to transfer upper layer PDUs by an AM RLC entity. It is used when the AM RLC entity needs to retransmit a portion of an AMD PDU.

### 6.1.2 RLC control PDU

a) STATUS PDU

STATUS PDU is used by the receiving side of an AM RLC entity to inform the peer AM RLC entity about RLC data PDUs that are received successfully, and RLC data PDUs that are detected to be lost by the receiving side of an AM RLC entity.

### 6.2 Formats and parameters

The formats of RLC PDUs are described in sub clause 6.2.1 and their parameters are described in sub clause 6.2.2.

### 6.2.1 Formats

### 6.2.1.1 General

RLC PDU is a bit string. In the figures in sub clause 6.2.1.2 to 6.2.1.6, bit strings are represented by tables in which the first and most significant bit is the left most bit of the first line of the table, the last and least significant bit is the rightmost bit of the last line of the table, and more generally the bit string is to be read from left to right and then in the reading order of the lines.

RLC SDUs are bit strings that are byte aligned (i.e. multiple of 8 bits) in length. An RLC SDU is included into an RLC PDU from first bit onward.

### 6.2.1.2 TMD PDU

TMD PDU consists only of a Data field and does not consist of any RLC headers.

Figure 6.2.1.2-1: TMD PDU

### 6.2.1.3 UMD PDU

UMD PDU consists of a Data field and an UMD PDU header.
UMD PDU header consists of a fixed part (fields that are present for every UMD PDU) and an extension part (fields that are present for an UMD PDU when necessary). The fixed part of the UMD PDU header itself is byte aligned and consists of a FI, an E and a SN. The extension part of the UMD PDU header itself is byte aligned and consists of E(s) and LI(s).

An UM RLC entity is configured by RRC to use either a 5 bit SN or a 10 bit SN. When the 5 bit SN is configured, the length of the fixed part of the UMD PDU header is one byte. When the 10 bit SN is configured, the fixed part of the UMD PDU header is identical to the fixed part of the AMD PDU header, except for D/C, RF and P fields all being replaced with R1 fields. The extension part of the UMD PDU header is identical to the extension part of the AMD PDU header (regardless of the configured SN size).

An UMD PDU header consists of an extension part only when more than one Data field elements are present in the UMD PDU, in which case an E and a LI are present for every Data field element except the last. Furthermore, when an UMD PDU header consists of an odd number of LI(s), four padding bits follow after the last LI.

### 6.2.1.4 AMD PDU

AMD PDU consists of a Data field and an AMD PDU header.
AMD PDU header consists of a fixed part (fields that are present for every AMD PDU) and an extension part (fields that are present for an AMD PDU when necessary). The fixed part of the AMD PDU header itself is byte aligned and consists of a D/C, a RF, a P, a FI, an E and a SN. The extension part of the AMD PDU header itself is byte aligned and consists of E(s) and LI(s).

An AM RLC entity is configured by RRC to use either a 10 bit SN or a 16 bit SN. The length of the fixed part of the AMD PDU header is two and three bytes respectively. The default values for SN field length used by an AM RLC entity is 10 bits.

An AMD PDU header consists of an extension part only when more than one Data field elements are present in the AMD PDU, in which case an E and a LI are present for every Data field element except the last. Furthermore, when an AMD PDU header consists of an odd number of $\mathrm{LI}(\mathrm{s})$ and the length of the LI field is 11 bits, four padding bits follow after the last LI. The default value for LI field length used by an AM RLC entity is 11 bits.

### 6.2.1.5 AMD PDU segment

AMD PDU segment consists of a Data field and an AMD PDU segment header.
AMD PDU segment header consists of a fixed part (fields that are present for every AMD PDU segment) and an extension part (fields that are present for an AMD PDU segment when necessary). The fixed part of the AMD PDU segment header itself is byte aligned and consists of a D/C, a RF, a P, a FI, an E, a SN, a LSF and a SO. The extension part of the AMD PDU segment header itself is byte aligned and consists of $\mathrm{E}(\mathrm{s})$ and $\mathrm{LI}(\mathrm{s})$.

AM RLC entity is configured by RRC to use either a 10 bit SN or a 16 bit SN. When a 10 bit SN is used, the SO field is 15 bits, and when a 16 bit SN is used, the SO field is 16 bits. The length of the fixed part of the AMD PDU segment header is four and five bytes respectively. The default values for SN field length and SO field length used by an AM RLC entity are 10 bits and 15 bits, respectively.

An AMD PDU segment header consists of an extension part only when more than one Data field elements are present in the AMD PDU segment, in which case an E and a LI are present for every Data field element except the last. Furthermore, when an AMD PDU segment header consists of an odd number of LI(s) and the length of the LI field is 11 bits, four padding bits follow after the last LI. The default value for LI field length used by an AM RLC entity is 11 bits.

The special SOend value "1111111111111111" or "11111111111111111" is used to indicate that the missing portion of the AMD PDU includes all bytes to the last byte of the AMD PDU.

## 7 Variables, constants and timers

### 7.1 State variables

This sub clause describes the state variables used in AM and UM entities in order to specify the RLC protocol. The state variables defined in this subclause are normative.

All state variables and all counters are non-negative integers.
All state variables related to AM data transfer can take values from 0 to 1023 for 10 bit SN or from 0 to 65535 for 16 bit SN. All arithmetic operations contained in the present document on state variables related to AM data transfer are affected by the AM modulus (i.e. final value = [value from arithmetic operation] modulo 1024 for 10 bit SN and 65536 for 16 bit SN).

All state variables related to UM data transfer can take values from 0 to $\left[2^{[s \text { n-FieldLength }]}-1\right]$. All arithmetic operations contained in the present document on state variables related to UM data transfer are affected by the UM modulus (i.e. final value $=$ [value from arithmetic operation] modulo $2^{[\text {sn-FieldLength }]}$ ).

AMD PDUs and UMD PDUs are numbered integer sequence numbers (SN) cycling through the field: 0 to 1023 for 10 bit SN and 0 to 65535 for 16 bit SN for AMD PDU and 0 to [ $\left.2^{[\text {sn-FieldLength }]}-1\right]$ for UMD PDU.

When performing arithmetic comparisons of state variables or SN values, a modulus base shall be used.
VT(A) and VR(R) shall be assumed as the modulus base at the transmitting side and receiving side of an AM RLC entity, respectively. This modulus base is subtracted from all the values involved, and then an absolute comparison is performed (e.g. VR(R) <= SN<VR(MR) is evaluated as [VR(R)-VR(R)] modulo $1024<=[\mathrm{SN}-\mathrm{VR}(\mathrm{R})]$ modulo $1024<[\mathrm{VR}(\mathrm{MR})$ - VR(R)] modulo 1024).

VR(UH) - UM_Window_Size shall be assumed as the modulus base at the receiving side of an UM RLC entity. This modulus base is subtracted from all the values involved, and then an absolute comparison is performed (e.g. (VR(UH) UM_Window_Size) <= SN < VR(UH) is evaluated as [(VR(UH) - UM_Window_Size) - (VR(UH) UM_Window_Size)] modulo $2^{[\text {sn-FieldLength }]}<=\left[\mathrm{SN}-\left(\mathrm{VR}(\mathrm{UH})-\mathrm{UM} \_\right.\right.$Window_Size $\left.)\right]$modulo $2^{[\text {sn-FieldLength }]}<[\mathrm{VR}(\mathrm{UH})-$ (VR(UH) - UM_Window_Size)] modulo $2^{[\text {sn-FieldLength }]}$ ).

The transmitting side of each AM RLC entity shall maintain the following state variables:
a) VT(A) - Acknowledgement state variable

This state variable holds the value of the SN of the next AMD PDU for which a positive acknowledgment is to be received in-sequence, and it serves as the lower edge of the transmitting window. It is initially set to 0 , and is updated whenever the AM RLC entity receives a positive acknowledgment for an AMD PDU with SN $=\mathrm{VT}(\mathrm{A})$.
b) VT(MS) - Maximum send state variable

This state variable equals VT(A) + AM_Window_Size, and it serves as the higher edge of the transmitting window.
c) VT(S) - Send state variable

This state variable holds the value of the SN to be assigned for the next newly generated AMD PDU. It is initially set to 0 , and is updated whenever the AM RLC entity delivers an AMD PDU with SN $=\mathrm{VT}(\mathrm{S})$.
d) POLL_SN - Poll send state variable

This state variable holds the value of VT(S)-1 upon the most recent transmission of a RLC data PDU with the poll bit set to " 1 ". It is initially set to 0 .

The transmitting side of each AM RLC entity shall maintain the following counters:
a) PDU_WITHOUT_POLL - Counter

This counter is initially set to 0 . It counts the number of AMD PDUs sent since the most recent poll bit was transmitted.
b) BYTE_WITHOUT_POLL - Counter

This counter is initially set to 0 . It counts the number of data bytes sent since the most recent poll bit was transmitted.
c) RETX_COUNT - Counter

This counter counts the number of retransmissions of an AMD PDU (see subclause 5.2.1). There is one RETX_COUNT counter per PDU that needs to be retransmitted.

The receiving side of each AM RLC entity shall maintain the following state variables:
a) VR(R) - Receive state variable

This state variable holds the value of the SN following the last in-sequence completely received AMD PDU, and it serves as the lower edge of the receiving window. It is initially set to 0 , and is updated whenever the AM RLC entity receives an AMD PDU with $\mathrm{SN}=\mathrm{VR}(\mathrm{R})$.
b) VR(MR) - Maximum acceptable receive state variable

This state variable equals VR(R) + AM_Window_Size, and it holds the value of the SN of the first AMD PDU that is beyond the receiving window and serves as the higher edge of the receiving window.
c) VR(X)- $t$-Reordering state variable

This state variable holds the value of the SN following the SN of the RLC data PDU which triggered $t$-Reordering.

Each transmitting UM RLC entity shall maintain the following state variables:
a) VT(US)

This state variable holds the value of the SN to be assigned for the next newly generated UMD PDU. It is initially set to 0 , and is updated whenever the UM RLC entity delivers an UMD PDU with SN $=$ VT(US).

Each receiving UM RLC entity shall maintain the following state variables:
a) VR(UR) - UM receive state variable

This state variable holds the value of the SN of the earliest UMD PDU that is still considered for reordering. It is initially set to 0 . For RLC entity configured for STCH, it is initially set to the SN of the first received UMD PDU.
b) VR(UX) - UM $t$-Reordering state variable

This state variable holds the value of the SN following the SN of the UMD PDU which triggered $t$-Reordering.
c) VR(UH) - UM highest received state variable

This state variable holds the value of the SN following the SN of the UMD PDU with the highest SN among received UMD PDUs, and it serves as the higher edge of the reordering window. It is initially set to 0 . For RLC entity configured for STCH, it is initially set to the SN of the first received UMD PDU.

### 7.2 Constants

a) AM_Window_Size

This constant is used by both the transmitting side and the receiving side of each AM RLC entity to calculate VT(MS) from VT(A), and VR(MR) from VR(R). AM_Window_Size = 512 when a 10 bit SN is used, AM_Window_Size = 32768 when a 16 bit SN is used.
b) UM_Window_Size

This constant is used by the receiving UM RLC entity to define SNs of those UMD PDUs that can be received without causing an advancement of the receiving window. UM_Window_Size $=16$ when a 5 bit SN is configured, UM_Window_Size = 512 when a 10 bit SN is configured and UM_Window_Size = 0 when the receiving UM RLC entity is configured for MCCH, MTCH, SC-MCCH, SC-MTCH or STCH.

### 7.3 Timers

The following timers are configured by RRC [5]:
a) $t$-PollRetransmit

This timer is used by the transmitting side of an AM RLC entity in order to retransmit a poll (see sub clause 5.2.2).
b) $t$-Reordering

This timer is used by the receiving side of an AM RLC entity and receiving UM RLC entity in order to detect loss of RLC PDUs at lower layer (see sub clauses 5.1.2.2 and 5.1.3.2). If $t$-Reordering is running, $t$-Reordering shall not be started additionally, i.e. only one $t$-Reordering per RLC entity is running at a given time.
c) $t$-StatusProhibit

This timer is used by the receiving side of an AM RLC entity in order to prohibit transmission of a STATUS PDU (see sub clause 5.2.3).

### 7.4 Configurable parameters

The following parameters are configured by RRC [5]:
a) maxRetxThreshold

This parameter is used by the transmitting side of each AM RLC entity to limit the number of retransmissions of an AMD PDU (see subclause 5.2.1).
b) pollPDU

This parameter is used by the transmitting side of each AM RLC entity to trigger a poll for every pollPDU PDUs (see subclause 5.2.2).
c) pollByte

This parameter is used by the transmitting side of each AM RLC entity to trigger a poll for every pollByte bytes (see subclause 5.2.2).
d) sn-FieldLength

This parameter gives the UM SN field size in bits (see subclause 7.1).
